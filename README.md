![architecture](/pics/architecture.png)

### About
The architecture of Tip App is mostly connected by explicit message-based calls from one component to another using Android intents. The app also utilizes a bounded service to support timer functionality, which calculates the amount of time elapsed since the start of a dining experience. The time elapsed is displayed to the user and serves as a value to be factored into the userâ€™s quantification of their dining experience. Apart from explicit method calls, Connectors are also implemented to support some of the key components of the app.</div>

### The Tip App consists of eight major components: 
* Main Menu
* Restaurant List
* Restaurant External Database(RESTful API based)
* Experience Review Page
* Timer
* Tip Result
* Experience SQLite Database
* History List
